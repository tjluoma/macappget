=========

Scripts to download and install 3rd party Mac apps 

**This program is not related to Apple, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries. All trademarked names are used only for the purposes of identification.**

## Purpose:

Have you ever wanted to download and install a Mac app that wasn't on the Mac App Store but you couldn't remember the name of the website? Maybe all you could remember was the name of the app?

Wouldn't it be nice if installing an app was as easy as installing a Unix utility via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)?

That's the idea behind `macappget`.

(Yes, I know that `brew` now has a way to 
[download, install, and update Mac apps](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask). 
Their way is probably better. I prefer my way.)
